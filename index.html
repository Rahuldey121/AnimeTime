      <h1>Itachi<br><span> Uchiha</span></h1>
      <p>Itachi Uchiha (うちは イタチ) is a character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi
        Kishimoto. Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha, and is responsible for killing all the members of their
        clan, sparing only Sasuke. He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and serves as
        Sasuke's greatest enemy. During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas
        possessing tailed-beast creatures until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during
        the final duel, it is later revealed that Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. </p>

      <h1>Naruto<br><span>Uzumaki</span></h1>
      <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto
        Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his
        village. The story is told in two parts—the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.
        The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable
        mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).</p>

      <p>The ugliness of not admitting defeat even though they took my head, chopped me up and crushed me. Living in
        disgrace. Have I lived hundreds of years for this? Was I so afraid of defeat that I became a monster? Did I want

        No. Yoriichi... I just wanted to be you..</p>
